# NOMAD

Getting to know the `rails-api` gem that ships with Rails 5.  So far, it's
simplified a few things I had to do manually in Rails 4.


* Ruby 2.2.2

* Rails 5

* Uses Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), in order to make cross-origin AJAX requests
possible.

# Next Steps:

## Add Authentication
Building an API means no session will be involved.  I'll need to authenticate the user in each request.

## Play with React.js
Add the `react-rails` gem .
